# 100 Days of Coding Challenge - TalentBattle Platform

Welcome to my **100 Days of Coding Challenge** repository! üéØ

I have embarked on this journey to solve **one coding problem every day** for the next 100 days, specifically focusing on **Java**. These problems will cover a range of topics from **basic Java programming** to **advanced Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**.

## What you‚Äôll find here:
- üìù **Problem Statement**: The daily coding challenge problem.
- üí° **Solution**: My Java solution.
- üìà **Progress Tracker**: My streak of consistency and progress throughout the challenge.
