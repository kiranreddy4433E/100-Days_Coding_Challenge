# Day 100: Maximum Number of Problem Sets 🎉

## 📝 Problem Description

You are given four problems with difficulty levels \( A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4 \). A **problem set** must meet the following conditions:

1. It contains at least two problems.
2. No two problems in a set have the same difficulty level.
3. A problem can belong to at most one problem set.

Your task is to determine the **maximum number of problem sets** that can be created using the four problems.

## 🚀 Approach

### Key Observations:
1. **Group by Difficulty**:
   - Count the frequency of each difficulty level using a hashmap.

2. **Sort Frequencies**:
   - Sort the difficulty frequencies in descending order to ensure the most frequent difficulties are used first.

3. **Form Problem Sets**:
   - For each iteration, try to create a problem set using the two most frequent difficulties, reducing their frequencies after use.

4. **Stop Condition**:
   - When fewer than two unique difficulties remain, no more problem sets can be created.

## 💻 Code

```java
package coading_Challange;

import java.util.*;

public class Day_100 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int T = sc.nextInt(); // Number of test cases

        while (T-- > 0) {
            int[] difficulties = new int[4];
            for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
                difficulties[i] = sc.nextInt();
            }
            System.out.println(maxProblemSets(difficulties));
        }

        sc.close();
    }

    private static int maxProblemSets(int[] difficulties) {
        // Count the frequency of each difficulty level
        Map<Integer, Integer> freq = new HashMap<>();
        for (int difficulty : difficulties) {
            freq.put(difficulty, freq.getOrDefault(difficulty, 0) + 1);
        }

        // Get frequencies as a list
        List<Integer> freqList = new ArrayList<>(freq.values());
        Collections.sort(freqList, Collections.reverseOrder()); // Sort in descending order

        int sets = 0;

        while (freqList.size() >= 2) {
            // Take two unique difficulties for a problem set
            freqList.set(0, freqList.get(0) - 1);
            freqList.set(1, freqList.get(1) - 1);

            // Remove difficulties that are exhausted
            if (freqList.get(0) == 0) freqList.remove(0);
            if (freqList.size() > 1 && freqList.get(1) == 0) freqList.remove(1);

            sets++;
        }

        return sets;
    }
}

## Explanation:

- Test Case 1: All difficulties are unique, so two sets can be formed: {1, 2} and {3, 4}.
- Test Case 2: Difficulties can be paired as {1, 2} and {1, 2}.

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- Frequency-based Greedy Approach:

- By always picking the most frequent difficulties first, we maximize the number of problem sets.
- Map and List Usage:

- HashMap for frequency counting and ArrayList for dynamic sorting and manipulation make solving such problems straightforward.
- Edge Case Handling:

- When fewer than two unique difficulties remain, no additional sets can be created.
